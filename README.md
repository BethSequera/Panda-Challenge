# PandaChallenge- Pandas School Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python project that utilizes the Pandas library to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Project Structure

- The main analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook named `PyCitySchools_main.ipynb`.
- The `Resources` folder contains the necessary CSV files for the analysis.


## Analysis Tasks

The project involves analyzing the data to derive various metrics and insights:

1. **District Summary**: Calculate key metrics for the entire district, such as the total number of schools, students, budget, and average scores. Generate a summary DataFrame.

2. **School Summary**: Aggregate data for each school, including student counts, budget per student, average scores, and passing percentages. Generate a summary DataFrame.

3. **Top-Performing Schools**: Identify the top-performing schools based on the overall passing percentage. Display the top 5 schools in a DataFrame.

4. **Bottom-Performing Schools**: Identify the bottom-performing schools based on the overall passing percentage. Display the bottom 5 schools in a DataFrame.

5. **Math and Reading Scores by Grade**: Calculate the average math and reading scores for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) across all schools. Create separate DataFrames for each subject.

6. **Scores by School Spending**: Categorize schools into spending ranges per student and analyze the average scores and passing percentages for each range. Generate a summary DataFrame.

7. **Scores by School Size**: Categorize schools into small, medium, and large based on their total student counts. Analyze the average scores and passing percentages for each category. Generate a summary DataFrame.

8. **Scores by School Type**: Analyze the average scores and passing percentages based on school types (charter or district). Generate a summary DataFrame.

## Observations and Summary

Include a written summary highlighting at least two key trends or insights observed from the analysis of the school and standardized test data.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. Make sure to have Pandas installed in your Python environment to run the analysis successfully.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `PyCitySchools_main.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook to run the analysis.
4. Review the generated summary DataFrames and the written summary for insights.
5. Refer to the comments and documentation within the notebook for more details on the analysis steps.
